                        <!-- <p>Health Care Travels Extortion Policy</p> -->
                        <p>Reviews/Critiques certainly are an easy method for Health Care Travels hosts and Travelers to
                            share with you their personal adventures with this area.&nbsp; Any effort to use critiques
                            and or reviews to induce an individual to make a move that they truly aren’t bound to do
                            would be an abuse of testimonials, also we actually don’t permit it.</p>
                        <p>This policy applies to scenarios such as, but not restricted to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clients threatening to-use critiques/reviews or evaluations in an effort to induce a
                                server to supply refunds, further reimbursement, or even some mutual favorable
                                inspection.
                            </li>
                            <li>Hosts needing a visitor to make a constructive inspection or review, or even to revise
                                an inventory beforehand to get a complete refund, or mutual inspection. Hosts can also
                                provide an entirely discounted or free stay ahead to get a visitor post an existent
                                inspection.
                            </li>
                            <li>Hosts requesting a person to carry certain activities associated with a critique
                                beforehand to get a settlement to your dispute involving the functions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This coverage doesn’t ban:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An individual from calling a server using a issue before leaving an overview.</li>
                            <li>A server by requesting an individual person to render an honest beneficial inspection or
                                score representing a constructive encounter.
                            </li>
                            <li>A guest or host out of studying an overview over the time limits for revision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After a critique or review is posted Hosts and Travelers cannot edit after they have
                            published.</p>
                        <p>By publishing a review/critique, you consent to stick to each of Health Care Travels policies
                            and guidelines, which includes the Extortion Policy, which Health Care Travels may possibly
                            apply in our sole discretion.&nbsp; Attempting to achieve this can end in the limitation,
                            suspension or conclusion of one’s Health Care Travels account.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
