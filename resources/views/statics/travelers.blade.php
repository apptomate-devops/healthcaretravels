                <p>We are glad to see you have picked Health Care Travels as your primary resource in finding short-term
                    housing for your next assignment. We hope that your time spent with us here on the Health Care
                    Travels platform will assist with all your short-term housing needs. To make this the
                    best-centralized website designed with you in mind there are pieces of advice and things we always
                    want you to keep in mind so that you get the best experience from Health Care Travels. We also want
                    to uphold a positive reputation for healthcare professionals and the Health Care Travels
                    platform. </p>
                <p>
                    As traveling healthcare professionals, we are expected to carry and have a distinguished mannerism
                    about ourselves. Here at Health Care Travels, we know that many of you relocate to new cities often
                    and hassle with finding trusted, safe and affordable housing. We have created this platform to
                    tailor to the needs of all traveling healthcare professionals such as travel a Nurse, CNA, Doctor,
                    Dentist, Therapist, and Social Worker to name a few. Furthermore, this platform will also need the
                    communities’ help, which is where homeowners will list their available housing options for you (the
                    traveler) to select from. We ask that each traveler respect and take care of each accommodation
                    booked here on Health Care Travels website as though it is your very own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What sets us apart as healthcare professionals is that the community understands that you are
                    traveling on work assignments to help those in need in their community. Homeowners also like the
                    peace of mind knowing you are on work assignments and are professionals, so that gives them comfort
                    in knowing no big parties or illegal drugs will enter their property.This is the safe, trusted
                    environment and reputation we would like to maintain as we grow. As we build this trusting
                    relationship between Travelers and Host, Health Care Travels wants to make sure everyone using this
                    platform is aware of the expectations set forth and failure to comply will result in termination of
                    your account or being banned. Below are some helpful tips to help your process go smoothly.

                <h4>Booking</h4><br>
                <p>Travelers that have previously had frequent assignments canceled, we suggest you book at intervals of
                    30 days or less at a time depending on the flexibility of the listings cancellation policy. If you
                    book at intervals of 30 days or more, you avoid being taxed. Anything less than 30 days will require
                    the host to collect the required taxes at check-in. We suggest that you communicate well with the
                    host asking all the necessary questions prior to booking. You should also communicate with the host
                    letting them know how long your assignment is expected to last or if your assignment is extended as
                    soon as possible. Keep in mind some of our homeowners have their properties listed on other websites
                    and Ical would tell you if the dates are available or not. So don’t hesitate to book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    ALWAYS, ALWAYS read the entire listing two or three times. Pay close attention and familiarize
                    yourself with the cancellation policies and house rules, so there are no misunderstandings. You
                    might even want to screenshot with your phone or print what the listing says, for the “just in case”
                    moments.
                </p>
                <p>*Please make note, if any payments are done outside of this platform between traveler and host,
                    Health Care Travels will not be involved if things don’t go as planned or any damages occur. We can
                    only be of assistance if reservations are made directly on our website. The goal is to keep both
                    parties safe. If you feel a traveler or a host is not in compliance with our policy, please contact
                    us.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Damages</h4><br>
                <p>On the rare chance, any damages occur, please inform the host right away. Keep in mind, that
                    depending on the nature of the damage, some security deposits can be used to compensate the host for
                    the damages after Health Care Travels reviews the damage claim. Again, take pictures to submit to us
                    on your behalf in the event damages happen. At check-in, there will be a form under the help tab or
                    emailed to you that must be signed and completed electronically before releasing the appropriate
                    funds to the host for your stay. At check-in time before you sign, you have 24-hours to make sure
                    the listing is the same as shown on our platform. Make a note of any items that are broken or not
                    working properly in the notes section. After 24 hours, funds will be released on your behalf to the
                    homeowner for your stay regardless if the check-in form is signed or not. If any damages occur after
                    the form is signed and submitted to us or not submitted to us, you may be responsible for any
                    additional damages submitted by the host that was not written on the form before both (Host and
                    Traveler) signed and dated.</p>

                <h4>Services</h4><br>

                    requesting a scout to verify listings. These tools are made available to you. The more they are
                    utilized the more you, as the traveler, can save money and possibly make money.</p>
