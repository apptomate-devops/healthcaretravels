			<p>Thank you for considering Health Care Travels as a place to become a host to traveling healthcare professionals on work assignment. We (Health Care Travels and Traveling healthcare professionals) are excited about the endless short-term housing opportunities you will be able to provide. Across the world, traveling healthcare professionals are looking to find short-term housing that is safe and affordable while on work assignments. We have created this platform to connect homeowners and travelers connect in a safe community to help prevent travelers from being scammed and misguided. This allows the platform to build trust between homeowners and healthcare travelers. In doing so, Health Care Travels will closely monitor and may ask you to provide forms of verification to utilize our platform in order to maintain a safe and secure environment. We also know that earning the right to be a host on our platform will not only build trust but also bring in a source of steady income for homeowners. As we (host, traveling healthcare professionals and Health Care Travels) take this journey together to be the best of its kind, we need joint effort. Below we have listed a few topics that we would like to cover and for you to keep in mind, so that you as the host can gain from you experience here on our platform. </p>

			<br><h4>Compliance with State Laws</h4>
			<p>You must be the owner of any property you list or have the legal authority to sublet and list on the Health Care Travels Platform. Keep in mind,  if a traveler makes a reservation or books 30 or more days, tax does not have to be collected or remitted. However, if a traveler books less than 30 days, you (The Host or Co-Host) are responsible for putting aside taxes and remitting every year, based on the state your property is located in. Health Care Travels will not be responsible for collecting or remitting any taxes for homeowners. Please familiarize yourself with the local and state laws of short-term rentals and tailor your listing to meet the appropriate standard. </p>

			<h4>Insurance</h4><br>
			<p>We encourage all hosts to obtain renters insurance. We understand that accidents can happen so we encourage hosts to shop around for renters insurance. We encourage the host to be aware of sentimental valuables by providing a place for safe-keeping to prevent possible damages.</p>

			<h4>Updated Calendar</h4>
			<p>We recognize that many of our hosts may have their short-term housing listed on other websites.</p>

			<p>We know that Health Care Travels is, or will become, your preferred platform due to the nature of longer bookings and how our healthcare professionals care for your property. We ask that you sync other platform calendars with our iCal feature, so there is no  overlapping of bookings and travelers can see if your accommodation is available for them during their time of travel. We strongly encourage our host to use our platform as their primary place to list properties, as travelers book for months at a time. It would be difficult if a traveler needs a booking for 3 months and when reviewing the calendar it shows the host has a 5 day vacation window booked in the middle of the 3 months needed for the healthcare traveler. This may result into travelers going to another listing. Please keep this in mind.</p>

			<h4>Scouts</h4>
			<p>If your listing has not been verified, a healthcare traveler may request our scout service. Hosts should be familiar with what our scout service is and agree to have a scout visit your property to verify that the listing is authentic for posting on our platform. Being verified shows the traveler that the property is real. There are different ways of getting a verified status. To learn more about what a scout is and how to become verified,

			<br>

			<h4>Cancellation</h4><br>
			<p>Here at Health Care Travels, we understand things come up. Thatâ€™s why we have created an <a href="{{url('/')}}/Extenuating-Circ-policy">Extenuating Circumstance policy</a> and a <a href="{{url('/')}}/travallers-refund-policy">Traveler Refund policy</a>. Please read them over and become familiar with our set forth <a href="{{url('/')}}/policies">policies</a>. Also, as a host, you have 4 cancellation options to choose from when listing your short-term property. Click here to review the options to select from. Please keep in mind, travelers will also review your cancellation policy selected for your listing that may be a determining factor whether they make a reservation with you or not. Travel assignments can be cancelled at anytime.</p>
			
			<h4>Deposit</h4><br>
			<p>If you are requesting the traveler to make a security deposit, Health Care Travels will hold all deposits on all listings until the time of the traveler's check-out. If any damage occur, depending on your selected cancellation policy, we (Health Care Travels) will determine from the facts presented by you (the host) and the traveler, who will receive the compensation or refund and the amount. Since we currently do not have a host guarantee, your deposit is your guarantee. We know that catering to the travel healthcare professionals on work assignment, reduces the risk of parties or illegal drugs and broken house rules. Health Care Travels will always stress the importance of taking care of homeowners property as if it was the traveler's home. At this time, we do not have a host guarantee, because we believe that all of our traveling healthcare professionals will hold to our standards or they will be banned from using our website. We have a zero tolerance for destructive behavior. The choice is up to the host regarding security deposits and obtaining renters insurance to provide extra safety measures for protecting their listing</p>
			<h4>Pictures</h4>
			<p>High quality pictures will drive greater traffic to your listing; Read our article for <a href="#"> eye-catching photos</a>. We also encourage you to copy your listing's link and post it to social media to direct more traffic to your listing.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Forms</h4>
			<p>There will be forms posted under the help tab and or emailed to assist with smooth check-ins, damage claims, and early traveler cancellations (if needed). Keep in mind, submitting these forms on time determines when your payout will be sent to you and will also serve as a contract agreement between you and the Traveler.
