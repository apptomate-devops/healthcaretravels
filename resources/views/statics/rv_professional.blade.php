                <p>Here at <b>Health Care Travels,</b> we understand that not only are traveling healthcare
                    professionals seeking short-term housing in different cities for work assignments. In
                    order to be an all-inclusive platform, we know that healthcare professionals are also
                    traveling by RV looking for campgrounds, parks, and resorts. At Health Care Travels,
                    we want to make sure those who are traveling by RV are safe on the road and have the
                    best available resources for them at all times. Our goal is to be the “Go to Site” for all
                    traveling healthcare professionals which include those traveling by personal RV. To help
                    us with that process, we need your feedback. We would like to know what resources
                    travelers think Health Care Travels should adopt to help healthcare professionals
                    traveling by RV. What could one website offer healthcare RV travelers to meet their
                    needs, help keep them safe and stress-free?
                </p>

                <p>For example RV campgrounds near medical centers and hospitals, discounts on Good
                    Sam Memberships and roadside assistance, connecting with other healthcare RV
                    travelers. Visit our help tab click on the contact us page to provide us with your
                    feedback using the contact form. We look forward to hearing from you!.</p><br>

                <p>*In our effort to seek the proper resources to assist with travelers traveling by RV, we
                    cannot guarantee all requests will be filled. In our best effort, Health Care Travels will
                    take into consideration all feedback. Once we have resources to assist with your travel
                    needs, the RV professionals tab is where you can refer back to for all updates and
                    upcoming events. </p><br><br>
