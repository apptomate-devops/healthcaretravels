                            time the Traveler’s booking request is accepted by the property owner, or at any other time mutually

                        <p>7.2.1 In order to receive a Payout you must have a valid Payout Method linked to your Health Care
                            Travels Account. Health Care Travels Payments will generally initiate Payouts to your selected
                            Payout Method: (i) for Accommodations within 24 hours of the Travelers scheduled check-in time (or
                            within 24 hours of 3:00pm local time - or 3:00pm UTC if local time is unknown - if the check-in time is
                            flexible or not specified); and (ii) for all other Traveler and Property Owner Services at the time
                            specified via the Health Care Travels Platform. (iii) Payouts are released once the traveler has safely
                            checked in and agrees that the accommodation is as it appears on Health Care Travels website. In
                            the event we are unable to hear from the traveler that is safely checked in we will release payment in
                            48 hours. (iii) Automatic payout on recurring monthly reservations which have already met the above
                            (i-iii) standards.

                            depend upon the Payout Method you select and the Payout Method provider’s processing schedule.
                            Health Care Travels Payments may delay or cancel any Payout for purposes of preventing unlawful

                        <p>7.2.3 Your Payout for a booking will be the Listing Fee less applicable Property Owner Fees.</p>
                        <p>7.2.4 In the event of a Travelers cancellation of a confirmed booking, Health Care Travels Payments
                            will remit a Payout of any portion of the Total Fees due to you under the applicable cancellation
                            policy.

                        <p>22.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) are contracting with
Health Care Travels Payments US; or (ii) bring any claim against any Health Care Travels Payments
entity in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 21).</p>
                        <p>22.2 <i>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</i>. Health Care Travels Payments is committed to
participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Payments Terms
provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 23.1 applies: (1) an informal
negotiation directly with Health Care Travels’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration
administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") using its specially designed Consumer
Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 22 and except as provided in Section 22.6).
Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:</p>
<ul class="ml-30">
    <li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (www.adr.org);</li>
    <li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
    <li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with
any party;</li>
    <li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
    <li>The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;</li>
    <li>The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone,
video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
    <li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve
the party’s individual claim.</li>
</ul>
                        <p>22.3 <i>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</i>. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and
Health Care Travels Payments each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to
negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have
provided to us; you can contact Health Care Travels’s customer service team by emailing us. If after
a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally,
the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the
arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand
for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>
                        <p><b>22.4 <i>Agreement to Arbitrate</i>. You and Health Care Travels Payments mutually agree that any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Payments Terms or the
breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the Payment
Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration (the "Arbitration
Agreement"). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced
or applies to our Dispute, you and Health Care Travels Payments agree that the arbitrator will
decide that issue.</b></p>
                        <p>22.5 <i>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</i>. You and Health Care Travels Payments each agree that
the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial
proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based
on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>
                        <p>22.6 <i>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</i>. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in
interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer
Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the
<b>"AAA Rules"</b>) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org
or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.</p>
                        <p>22.7 <i>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</i>. In order to make the arbitration most
convenient to you, Health Care Travels Payments agrees that any required arbitration hearing may
be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in Harris County; (c) in any
other location to which you and Health Care Travels Payments both agree; (d) via phone or video
conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of
documents to the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>22.8 <i>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs</i>. You and Health Care Travels
Payments agree that Health Care Travels Payments will be responsible for payment of the balance
of any initial filing fee under the AAA Rules in excess of $200 for claims of $75,000 or less. You may
be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent
provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim
was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, Health Care Travels Payments agrees it will not
seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover
attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
                        <p>22.9 <i>Arbitrator’s Decision</i>. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and
conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
claimant’s individual claim.</p>
                        <p><b>22.10 <i>Jury Trial Waiver</i>. You and Health Care Travels Payments acknowledge and agree that
we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</b></p>
                        <p><b>22.11 <i>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</i>. You and Health Care Travels
Payments acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a
plaintiff or class User in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private
attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further,
unless you and Health Care Travels Payments both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator
may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any
form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with
respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void
with respect to such Dispute.</b></p>
                        <p>22.12 <i>Severability</i>. Except as provided in Section 22.11, in the event that any portion of this
Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the
remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</p>
                        <p>22.13 <i>Changes</i>. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 ("Modification of these Payments
Terms"), if Health Care Travels Payments changes this Section 22 ("Dispute Resolution and
Arbitration Agreement") after the date you last accepted these Payments Terms (or accepted any
subsequent changes to these Payments Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us

any Dispute between you and Health Care Travels Payments in accordance with the provisions of
