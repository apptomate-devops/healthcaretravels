                    professionals in securing affordable short-term housing. We are a specialized website providing a
                    centralized platform to help travel healthcare professionals find affordable and reliable short-term
                    housing. Property owners can list properties they wish to rent to healthcare professionals on a work
                    assignment. Healthcare travelers can locate short-term housing needs, pay for reservations securely
                    online, and also request a roommate, become a scout or request scout services for unverified

                    assignment.
