                        <p>You agree that a confirmed booking of an accommodation (“Accommodation Booking”) is a limited
                            license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the
                            limited duration of the Accommodation Booking, during which time the Host (only where and to
                            the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in
                            accordance with your agreement with the Host.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies
                            in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you
                            stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host’s consent (“Overstay”), you no
                            longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you
                            leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if
                            requested by the Host, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that
                            you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing
                            Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all
                            applicable Traveler Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make you
                            leave (collectively, “Overstay Fees”). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date
                            that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the
                            Host as a result of such Overstay. HCT Payments will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant

                            Travelers or Hosts on Listing Fees, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The
                            laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted
                            as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations,

                            amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by HCT will be visible to and
                            separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where

                            and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes
                            collected by HCT from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>HCT is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try
                            to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in
                            this section. This section lays out: (1) the initial process you must follow by reporting
                            your claim to HCT prior to filing any arbitration or lawsuit in accordance with this
                            section; and (2) binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
                            (“AAA”).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Prior to initiating arbitration, you and HCT each agree to notify the other party of the
                            dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at
                            the email address you have provided to us; you can contact HCT’s customer service team by
                            emailing us at [insert email] (the “Internal Review Procedure”). Your email to [insert
                            email] beginning the Internal Review Procedure must contain the following information: (1)
                            your name, (2) your address, (3) the email address you used to make your reservation, (4)
                            your reservation number, (5) the date of your reservation, (6) the name of the property that
                            you reserved, (7) a brief description of the nature of your complaint, and (8) the
                            resolution that you are seeking (together, the “Required Information”). Additionally, the
                            subject line of your email must state, “Request Under Disputes Provision.”</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be
                            resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other
                            party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a
                            claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at<a
                                href="#"> www.adr.org</a>) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><b>You and HCT mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
                                relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation
                                thereof, or to the use of the Platform, the Host Services, or the Collective Content

                                Agreement”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be
                                enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and HCT agree that the arbitrator will decide
                                that issue.</b></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You and HCT each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement
                            and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any
                            claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
                            party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
                            rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances
                            (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the
                            Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
                            arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules
                            (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at<a

                        <p>In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, HCT agrees that any required
                            arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside;
                            (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and HCT both agree; (d)
                            via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely
                            the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in
                            arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the
                            arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment,
                            HCT agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law
                            or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
                            arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court
                            with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on
                            an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
                            claimant’s individual claim.</p>
