                            know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Platform,
                            such as registering for an account, sending a booking request or inquiry from you to a
                            property owner or manager, submitting a Listing, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to
                            provide certain information about yourself.</p>
                        <p>Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address

                        <p>We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. Although it is
                            not compulsory to give us this information, if you do not then you cannot register as a User
                            of the Platform or make a booking for accommodation with our Hosts or Co-Host.</p>
                        <p>To help create and maintain a trusted environment, we may collect identification (like a
                            photo of your government-issued ID) or other authentication information. To learn more,

                        <p><strong>Aggregate Information: </strong> This refers to information that does not by itself
                            identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you
                            visit on our Platform and what other websites may have directed you to us. This information,
                            which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a
                            personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website’s Uniform

                            after visiting our Platform, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”)

                            institutions or payment processors, we encrypt the transaction, using Secure Socket Layer
                            (SSL) encryption technology, in order to prevent your PII from being stolen or intercepted.
                            Additionally, your credit card information<em>:</em> is never stored on our servers or is
                            encrypted and stored on a restricted-access database that is away from our main Platform and
                            only accessible by authorized users.</p>
                        <p>We will primarily use your PII to provide certain Services to you. We will also use certain
                            forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Platform, improve our internal marketing and
