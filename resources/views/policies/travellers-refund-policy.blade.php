                        <p>The terms and conditions contained in this policy show Health Care Traveler’s policy for
                            Traveler refunds (Traveler Refund Policy) and what is required of the Host concerning the

                            of Use]&#8203;. The Traveler Refund Policy is available to Travelers who make reservations
                            and pay for accommodation via the Health Care Traveler Platform and experience a Travel
                            Challenge (defined below). The rights of the Traveler as provided in this Traveler Refund
                            Policy shall supersede the Host’s cancellation policy.</p>
                        <p>All the terms in capitalization shall retain the interpretation provided in the Health Care
                            Travels Terms of Service or Payment Terms unless this Traveler Refund Policy states
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Usage of the Health Care Travels platform as a Traveler or Host indicates that you have read
                            and understood clearly and agree that this Traveler Refund Policy will be binding on
                            you.</p>

                            whether another entity such as the Host will also be using the unit during the

                            description, cleanliness, safety, and do not result into Travel Challenges to the Traveler.
                            Hosts should be available or provide a third-party while the Traveler is staying at the
                            Accommodation, to ensure that any Travel Challenges are resolved amicably……….</p>
                        <p>4.2 As a Host, if (i) Health Care Travels concludes that a Traveler has suffered a Travel
                            Challenge in relation to an Accommodation on your listing and (ii) Health Care Travels
                            reimburses that Traveler up to the total amount of fees paid or finds an alternative
                            Accommodation to the Traveler, you agree to reimburse Health Care Travels the total amount
                            reimbursed to the Traveler within 30 days of Health Care Travels’ request. If we provided an
                            alternate Accommodation to the Traveler, you also agree to reimburse Health Care Travels the
                            additional costs required to relocate the Traveler. You agree to authorize Health Care

                            the Traveler supersede your selection of cancellation policy. If you disagree with a Travel
                            Challenge, give us a [notice in writing] or via telephone and provide us information (such
                            as photographs or other evidence) disputing the claims of the Traveler over the Travel
